# Tourist-Guide-Site-Using-APIs

Project from COMPX322 Advanced Web Dev where we were tasked in creating a web app which utilizes APIs and makes use of AJAX, fetch and cURL to perform the API requests. Makes use of JSON and XML for response data from the APIs. Additions and fixes will be made to improve on the assignment version.
